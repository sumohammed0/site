              Hey! I'm Safa. An average junior in highschool from Dallas, Texas.
              I enjoy reading books, biking, cooking, eating food, and sleeping
              among other activities. I love meeting new people and getting to
              know them.

              My favorite book series is probably the Throne of Glass series by
              Sarah J. Mass. My favorite foods are pasta, noodles, and philly
              cheesesteak. My favorite drink is Dr. Pepper. My favorite fruits
              are strawberries and mangoes. I don't have a favorite tv show
              currently but I enjoy watching anime and some of my favorites are
              Naruto and Hunter x Hunter. My favorite subject right now is Math
              which is uncommon but it's the only one that made sense this past
              year during school.
